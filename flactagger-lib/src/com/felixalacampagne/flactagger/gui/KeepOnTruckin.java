/**
 * Attempts to prevent the system from entering sleep mode while a length operation is being performed.
 * On Windows the system will enter sleep/hibernate mode even when the CPU is at 100%. There is a Win32 API
 * call which will stop sleep (SetThreadExecutionState) but the JNI call would add an external dependency 
 * that I want to avoid, same for the JNA library in github.
 * 
 * Since I don't want the noise associated with the solution requiring a mouse on a subwoofer, and 
 * my Dyson cool fan doesn't have any fan blades to strap the mouse to I will have to resort to 
 * moving the mouse programmatically. Don't know if it will work but a similar thing done in Perl
 * did help.
 *
 * The threading stuff didn't turn out like I intended as I didn't realise that a thread that has
 * finished it's run() cannot simply be re-started. I wanted to avoid multiple mouse moving threads
 * from being started. I think I've managed that with the restricted access constructor and by not
 * exposing the static instance of the class.
